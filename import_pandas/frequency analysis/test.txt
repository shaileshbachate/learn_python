Frequent Pattern Analysis
Apriori Algorithm 
Apriori algorithm refers to an algorithm that is used in
mining frequent products sets and relevant association rules.
 - Support   : transaction containing A / Total transaction
 - confidence : conditional probability of A and B



CLustering 

K Means : K means uses centroids. It takes k randomly initiated points from the data
          as centroids & assigns every point to nearest centroid.
	  Or else we can calculate inertia curve to determine number of clusters.
	  more efficient for large dataset
	  constraint of number of clusters


DBSCAN : Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
	 given a set of points in some space, it groups together points
	 that are closely packed together.
	 Core points and outliers
	 Epsilon : radius of neighbourhood
	 min samples : minimum point in radius to qualify as core point
	 
Hierarchical clustering : -> Agglomerative/Agnes (bottom up) : 
				each observation is treated as cluster and then merged
				as one moves up in hierarchy
				Dendogram structure
			  -> Divisive (top down)

Agnes performed best since no overlap was seen
