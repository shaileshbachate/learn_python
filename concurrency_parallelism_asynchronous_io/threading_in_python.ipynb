    "## Use of context managers for concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a context manager is an object that defines methods to be used in conjunction with the \"with\" statement, specifically `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. The code within the \"with\" block is the managed context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor()`, the context manager is used to handle the setup and teardown of resources (in this case, threads). When the \"with\" block is entered, the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is instantiated and its `__enter__` method is called. When the \"with\" block is exited, the `__exit__` method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__exit__` method of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` context manager calls `executor.shutdown(wait=True)`, which will wait until all threads have finished executing before tearing down the `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This ensures that all threads have completed before the program continues, preventing any threads from being cut off prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using `ThreadPoolExecutor` as a context manager in this context ensures that the executor is properly cleaned up when it is no longer needed, and that all threads have finished executing before the program continues. It's a way to manage resources effectively and cleanly in Python."
