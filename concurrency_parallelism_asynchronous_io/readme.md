## Q. What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading in Python?

In Python, both multithreading and multiprocessing are ways to achieve multitasking, but they have key differences:

**Multithreading**:
- Threads run in the same memory space, while processes have separate memory³.
- All the threads in a program share the same context⁴.
- Threads are best for I/O tasks or tasks involving delays, like waiting for user input or fetching data from a database².
- Due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, threads can't execute Python bytecodes simultaneously on multiple cores¹⁴.
- The `threading` module in Python is used for multithreading¹.

**Multiprocessing**:
- Each process has a separate GIL and instance of a Python interpreter⁴.
- Processes do not share memory space, making it harder to share objects between processes³.
- Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL and utilizes multiple CPUs for execution¹⁴.
- It's best for CPU-intensive tasks².
- The `multiprocessing` module in Python is used for multiprocessing¹.

In summary, use multithreading when tasks are I/O-bound and multiprocessing when tasks are CPU-bound².
